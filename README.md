# Advanced-Text-Analytics-and-Query-System-with-LangChain-and-Cassandra

# PDF Text Extraction and Analysis: Engineered a system to extract text from PDF documents, using LangChain combined with OpenAI's language models. This enabled advanced text analytics, allowing for the deep understanding and contextual interpretation of content within PDF files.

# Query-Based Information Retrieval from PDFs: Developed an interactive query interface that allows users to ask natural language questions about the contents of a PDF. The system leverages AI-driven text analytics to provide precise answers, enhancing the ability to rapidly gain insights from complex PDF documents.

# Cassandra Database Integration for Scalable Data Management: Integrated the text analytics system with the Cassandra database, ensuring efficient storage, indexing, and retrieval of processed PDF text data. This setup showcases the ability to handle large volumes of data and provides a robust infrastructure for scalable text analytics.
